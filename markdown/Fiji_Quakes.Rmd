# 1

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
data(quakes)
```
```{r str&sum, echo=FALSE}
str(quakes)
summary(quakes)
```
Number of observations is 1000, shows basic descriptive statistics, and shows the values for each entry are coordinates, depth, magnitude, and station number

# 2
```{r quakes_long, echo=FALSE}
unlist(quakes['long'])
```
So many values here even when you unlist so the page doesn't become too long

# 3
```{r quakes_unique, echo=FALSE}
print(paste('There are ', length(unique(quakes$stations)), ' stations', sep=''))
```
# 4
```{r quakes_range, echo=FALSE}
range(quakes['depth'])
print(paste('The minimum depth detected is ', min(quakes$depth), ' km and the maximum depth detected is ', max(quakes$depth), ' km', sep=''))
```

# EC
```{r quakes_ec, echo=FALSE}
print(paste('Station number ', quakes[quakes$mag == max(quakes['mag']),]$stations, ' had the highest magnitude earthquake', sep=''))
```
